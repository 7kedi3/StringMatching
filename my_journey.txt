F: Forked the project as said and created this file. Now trying to understand what is wanted from us.
F: Learned Bad Character Rule and now implementing it to create bad character shift table. Used this (https://dwnusbaum.github.io/boyer-moore-demo/) interactive demo to fully understand the implementation. 
F: While implementing BoyerMoore algorithm, it came to my mind that maybe we can implement our own "creative" algorithm by trying to put what we do as humans into code.
F: BoyerMoore algoritm fails in "empty pattern" and "both empty" test cases but successfully passes "empty text" test. This is very odd. 

L:I used Gemini3's learning guide and "Dynamic View" tools to compare string matching algorithms, which helped me learn faster and better.
L:I realized I couldn't understand KMP string matching by watching videos, so I think I understand both LPS and KMP in general by using this website: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/kmp-algorithm-for-pattern-searching/
L:I learned how LPS table is constructed and how it prevents unnecessary comparasions, and ı found it challenging to correctly implement the LPS preprocessing step.
L:I learned how the bad-character and good-suffix heuristics work together to skip large sections of the text, and I found the good-suffix table construction the most challenging part.
L:I learned how the rolling hash works and why it allows fast window updates, and I found it challenging to correctly handle hash collisions.
L:I think this homework was challenging but rewarding, and it helped me understand practical performance improvements.

F: Did a little brainstorming using gemini as assistant, I come to a conclusion that we can make a better verison of our BoyerMoore algorithm. 
My thinking was as follows:
Why would anyone go fishing at the very edge of a coast, when an entire ocean of fish lies in the middle.
The chances of finding something at start or end is less unlikely than finding it in between them. Using this idea, we implemented similar BoyerMoore algorithm where we start from the center and search outwards until we find match.
